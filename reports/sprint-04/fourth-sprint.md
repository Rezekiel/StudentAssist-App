## UI/UX Artifacts
* The interface is the simplistic and minimalistic design of this generation. Simplicity is a major factor, that is why the application is simple to be used by our users. Remembering the three main features; the features include authenticated login for students, a voice assistant to help you with your class problems, and a location based attendance check in that helps the teacher and student.
