# Sprint-05 Written Report

## Team 15W
* Davon Branch - Developer
* Bryant McGee - UI/UX
* Olu Ogunsanya
* Raymond Ezekiel- Infrastructure/Project Manager

## UI/UX Artifacts
* For the UI we decided to maintain a simple, basically default design. This was done in order to focus our attention of the development of the rest of the Application

* Overall design of the UI changed between the last sprints due the needed completion of other parts of the app. The plan was to have the UI widgets that we created in adobe XD converted to dart code and implemented into the app. 

* The interface is the simplistic and minimalistic design of this generation. Simplicity is a major factor, that is why the application is simple to be used by our users.
