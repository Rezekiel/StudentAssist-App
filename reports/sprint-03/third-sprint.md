## Project Manager Artifacts
Admin Story
![signup](/diagrams/UI/signup.jpg)
* The first screen shown displays what the admin sees. They are brought to a sign in page to access necessary features. They have the option to sign up which all users will do to create data information to cross check.
![login](/diagrams/UI/login.png)
* There is also a sign in page shown as that is what we will be using after signing up.
![overview](/diagrams/UI/overview.png)
* Next the admins of the page are brought to a dashboard screen. This essentially shows the admins statistics such as usage frequency and so on.
![inbox](/diagrams/UI/inbox.jpg)
* Here we have the inbox page. This enables us, the admins, to communicate with the next in chain users, the professors. They can voice suggestions, opinions, complains etc to us via this inbox set up.
![chatroom](/diagrams/UI/chatroom.jpg)
* Here is a chat room page set up for the admins of the mobile application. This chat room was created to separate message and communication between our users and ourselves. This is what distinguishes the inbox to the chat room. This enables us to effortlessly communicate with one another.
![customers](/diagrams/UI/customers.jpg)
* Here we have a customers page. This is essentially made for us to keep track of our users. This will be mostly entailed of professors as they will be the next in the chain then the students under them.
![calender](/diagrams/UI/calender.jpg)
* This page consists of a calendar. This calendar will act as a Kanban Board (such as Trello) for us. Itâ€™ll ensure we are on track with possible deadlines, maintenance dates and so on.

### User Story

A student at IIT opens the app and they are exposed to this beautiful loading screen.

Student has chosen the attendance check in button. They have the option of choosing a class to mark their attendance for the day.
![Tap](/diagrams/UI/IMG_5110.JPG)
Once student chooses a class to check in, they will be taken to this screen to start the process.
![Location](/diagrams/UI/IMG_5111.JPG)
The application will then check the student's location to make sure they are in the classroom.
![Accept](/diagrams/UI/IMG_5112.JPG)
If the student's location is accepted, they will arrive at this screen and recieve a code to be able to check in properly.
![Success](/diagrams/UI/IMG_5113.JPG)
The students location and code was accepted and has been marked present for the class lecture.
![Home](/diagrams/UI/IMG_5108.JPG)
The student is back at the main screen where they can now select the left button (student AI assistant)
![AI](/diagrams/UI/IMG_5114.JPG)
This is where the student will press the voice button on the screen and ask the application specific questions. For example: "what time is my ITMT-430 class?" or "What day is assignment one due for ITM 301?"
